# PORTFOLIO

## The Navbar
I started to create a new portfolio for myself by adding a navbar to the top section, and when clicking on the links it will redirect you to the section on the page. 

## The Logo/Profile Picture
I didn't have any professional photos or logos I've created. I decided to upload a photo that I have currently that would work best. 

## About Me
I added some information about why I am interested in coding. I will continuously update this as I go along with more and more experience. 

## Projects
I uploaded a few photos that are currently acting as placeholders, and not any real projects just yet. This will of course be continuously updated as I go along with more work to showcase my experience. 

## Footer
I added my contact information, minus real phone number for privacy reasons as this is not a private page. 

## HTML & CSS Files
I didn't have a ton of semantic html elements, but I had some. I did leave notes on both my html and css file for easier read when going through and making adjustments. I checked using the developer tools on Google Chrome to make sure it ws UI responsive on multiple devices.
